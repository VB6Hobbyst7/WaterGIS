# WaterGIS
Many efforts on the managing of water supply system have been made for sustainable water supply, in recent decades, in IRAN. However, the complexity of hydraulic analysis such as velocity and pressure, made it very challenging to develop a comprehensive system with potential of both hydraulic and GIS analysis. The WaterGIS system was developed as tightly coupled spatial decision support system (SDSS) to assist managers in a well-designed user friendly interface. The SDSS components (Model management component (MMC), Dialog management component (DMC), Database management component (DBMC)) were integrated using Visual studio environment. By developing this system, water management experts are able to do both hydraulic and GIS analysis in a supportive system for decision making.
